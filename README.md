## Supermarket Sales on Shiny Dashboard

This project was done in to complete the Developing Data Products course by JHU via [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). The gif below provides a very brief tutorial of the dashboard, with its capability to utilize plotly for stacking and filter applications in many graphs, along with another tab continuously running a linear regression model to predict how much a customer will spend at their visit to the supermarket based on the many features the user can change.

A brief report on regression model selection is included here and can be seen [here](https://github.com/gdq12/Shiny_Dashboard/blob/master/model_eval.md).

The dashboard is up on the shiny server and can be visited [here](https://gdq12.shinyapps.io/shiny_dashboard/), although its advised **not to use chrome to visit the dashboard** since there are issues with java script in rendering plots and running the prediction. It has successfully functioned in safari server presently. A very brief project pitch prepared for the course was prepared using Rpres and uploaded to [Rbubs](https://rpubs.com/gdquiceno/657661).
